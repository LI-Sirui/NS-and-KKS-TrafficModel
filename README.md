# NS-and-KKS-TrafficModel
Simulation a three lane highway with overtaking/lane-changing(for 2 and 3 lanes), lane 1 can not overtaking, and cars with different maximum speeds.

## Sub-projects
1. [**NS Traffic model**](https://github.com/LI-Sirui/NS-and-KKS-TrafficModel/blob/main/Road1.py). Simulate a one-lane highway.
2. KKS traffic model. Simulate a two-lane highway with overtraking/lane-changing.


### Final project
The final project is to simulate a three-lane highway, which is a combination of the NS and KKS Model.
